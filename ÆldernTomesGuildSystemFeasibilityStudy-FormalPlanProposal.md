**Ældern Tomes Guild System Feasibility Study \- Formal Plan Proposal**

**Prepared for Strategic Review and Investor Consideration**

**Executive Summary**

This document presents a comprehensive feasibility study for the Ældern Tomes Guild System. This system proposes a gamified, community-driven retail experience that integrates mythic storytelling, symbolic rituals, and membership-based engagement. This study encompasses detailed game mechanics, financial modeling, technical and legal feasibility, and serves as a strategic blueprint for transforming Ældern Tomes from a collectible bookseller into an interactive narrative world and immersive platform.

**Project Phases Overview**

The project will be executed in three core phases, each with specific objectives and timelines:

**Phase 1: Foundational Framework & Initial Market Scan (6–8 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Establish the core conceptual framework and gather preliminary market data.  
* **Key Activities:**  
  * Define lore-based Guild classes and roles (e.g., Archivist, Forager).  
  * Develop initiation rites and a hierarchical rank structure imbued with symbolic significance.  
  * Design party-up and cross-classing systems to facilitate member interaction.  
  * Establish initial Experience Points (XP) and Role-Playing Points (RP) systems with clear earning and spending logic.  
  * Define draft Guild Dues tiers and an outline for a Founders Tier.  
  * Identify the minimum viable platform stack (e.g., eCommerce platform and community hub).  
  * Develop initial quest types, example rituals, and progression paths within the system.  
  * Conduct a preliminary market uniqueness scan and develop initial audience profiles.

**Phase 2: Deep Dive Analysis & System Refinement (8–10 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Conduct in-depth analysis and refine the system based on initial findings.  
* **Key Activities:**  
  * Refine game mechanics and class-specific quests based on initial feedback and analysis.  
  * Model the RP economy and the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for tangible rewards.  
  * Validate the legal structure, including considerations for dues, RP as a potential currency, and data privacy regulations.  
  * Develop and review draft Terms of Service (ToS) and a Privacy Policy.  
  * Finalize the operational model for the "Artificer Storefront" (the reward and merchandise component).  
  * Create a three-year financial forecast and stress-test the revenue model.  
  * Build a working prototype of the XP/RP tracking system, which may be manual or technological.  
  * Select final technology platforms and develop an integration plan.

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Strategic Blueprint (4–6 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Consolidate findings, create final documentation, and prepare for launch.  
* **Key Activities:**  
  * Assemble the full "Ældern Codex": a comprehensive document containing system rules, quests, rituals, and rewards.  
  * Develop a visual pitch deck for potential funding or collaborators.  
  * Draft the Guild Charter and Founders Handbook, which will outline the governance and operational principles.  
  * Publish a go-to-market roadmap with Minimum Viable Product (MVP) milestones.  
  * Refine the brand voice for the website, events, and overall community tone.
