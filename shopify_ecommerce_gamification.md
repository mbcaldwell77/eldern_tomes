# How Ecommerce Gamification Drives Sales (2024) - Shopify

Gaming is nothing new. Archeologists not long ago unearthed a [5,000-year-old dice set](), and psychologists have [documented]() how gameplay meets basic human needs like socialization, exploration, and achievement. In other words, humans are wired to play games. What is relatively new, however, is how businesses are using game-like structures to meet their goals.

“Gamification can be applied at every stage of the marketing funnel,” says Adrien Pin, founding partner at gamification studio [Merci-Michel](), “so it’s a good idea, whatever your problem: lead generation, user retention, comprehension of product, conversion rate, highly competitive business, etc.” By turning shopping into a game, you can capture your audience’s attention and ultimately increase sales.

Here’s an introduction to gamification for ecommerce business owners, including types, benefits, and examples of real-world companies revolutionizing shopping with gamification.

## What is ecommerce gamification?

Ecommerce gamification is a marketing strategy where an ecommerce business creates game-like experiences to engage customers and promote loyalty and sales. 

Gamification strategies can replicate familiar games or incorporate standard game elements into your sales and marketing materials. Many ecommerce websites use gaming elements like points, achievement levels, and progress visualizations to engage customers and boost ecommerce sales.

## Essential gamification techniques

*   Win-a-discount
*   Quizzes
*   Loyalty programs
*   Challenges
*   Competitions
*   Progress visualization

Here are six common gamification techniques:

### 1. Win-a-discount

A win-a-discount gamification strategy gives browsers the chance to earn a promotional offer by playing a game on your ecommerce site. Spin-to-win is a popular example: Shoppers spin a virtual wheel to win incentives, like a percentage off a purchase, depending on where the wheel stops. Common variations include choosing a mystery gift box, rolling virtual dice, or scratching off a virtual lottery ticket. 

### 2. Quizzes

With quizzes, customers answer questions to earn rewards or receive personalized product recommendations. You can use trivia-style quizzes to engage users on a particular subject, like the life cycle of a coffee bean or proper saltwater aquarium maintenance. 

You can also deploy personality test-style quizzes to collect users’ data: Quizzes like “Find your haircare archetype” or “What’s the best watch for your lifestyle?” can boost engagement and provide valuable insights into customer preferences.

### 3. Loyalty programs

[Loyalty programs]() reward customer loyalty with points, discounts, or other incentives. You typically award points for actions like making purchases, referring new clients, or reviewing products on social channels. Many loyalty programs also use game-like user interfaces and elements like customer achievement levels, badges, and progress visualizations.

### 4. Challenges

Challenges reward users for completing specific actions, typically within a specified time period. An early bird challenge, for example, might offer a free gift to the first 100 customers who purchase a product, and a referral challenge might provide discount codes to customers who refer three friends in one week.

### 5. Competitions

Use competitions to encourage social sharing and increase brand awareness. Social media photo contests are a common example: Instruct users to post their best product photos, and the photo with the most likes or engagements wins. 

Competitions can also encourage creative engagement with your products. A sandwich cookie company might hold a contest to see who can build the tallest sandwich cookie stack, and a makeup company might offer an award for the best new makeup style using its product line.

### 6. Progress visualization

Use progress visualization to motivate customers to reach a specific goal. They’re often part of quizzes or loyalty programs but can be used independently to gamify specific aspects of the online shopping experience. Free shipping progress bars are one example: These visualizations entice users to reach free shipping thresholds by tracking progress as customers add items to their carts.

Here’s how leading ecommerce companies are using gamified loyalty programs, interactive campaigns, contests, and [augmented reality]() (AR) and [virtual reality]() (VR) to increase engagements and boost sales: 

### 1. KENZO Shopping League

Adrien Pin and [Merci-Michel]() created the multiplayer online game Shopping League to promote fashion brand [KENZO’s]() limited edition Sonic sneaker. “We created Shopping League to mimic what can happen when there’s a rare pair of sneakers being dropped,” Adrien says. “Users had to queue virtually before entering the online store, and, once inside, they had a limited time to buy the product.” 

KENZO strategically admitted more customers than they had product, requiring shoppers to compete for the right to make a purchase. “To actually buy the product, participants had to battle in one-on-one duels via a fairly simple clicker mini-game,” explains Adrien. “We created an event that generated even more desirability around the project, which was already intended to be exclusive. All the pairs were sold out within 12 hours and there was huge PR coverage, which gave a big exposure to the brand and the product.”

### 2. Farfetch Access Rewards

Ecommerce fashion retailer Farfetch rewards customers with a tiered loyalty program, [Access Rewards](). The program has five tiers: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and private client. New customers earn bronze status, which unlocks a welcome coupon and a birthday month discount. 

Customers earn points for purchases and can qualify for exclusive sales and discounts, free shipping, priority customer care, and even a personal stylist. Gamification elements include rewards, achievement levels, and progress visualization...1261 bytes truncated...
